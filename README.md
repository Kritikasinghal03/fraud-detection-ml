# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview
- Built a fraud detection model using Logistic Regression
- Handled class imbalance using class-weighted learning
- Used pipelines and column transformers to prevent data leakage
- Evaluated performance using confusion matrix and recall-focused metrics
- Deployed the trained pipeline using a Streamlit web application

## Files in this Repository
- `fraud_model.ipynb` – Data analysis, feature engineering, model training
- `fraud_detection_pipeline.pkl` – Saved preprocessing + model pipeline
- `app.py` – Streamlit web app for real-time fraud prediction
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python libraries

## How to Run the App
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
